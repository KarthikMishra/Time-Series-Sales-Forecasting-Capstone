# Time-Series-Sales-Forecasting-Capstone
The focus of this project was to predict the Sales Price of the Rossman Stores. The dataset consists of Train , Test and Store datasets which contain the data for 1115 Rossman Stores.

The features in the dataset that are affecting the Sales of the Rossman Stores are taken into consideration during forecasting of the Sales.

We built multiple models like AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR and VARMAX

The best model is the VAR (Vector Auto-Regressive) model as it has the lowest values for RMSE and MAPE across all the models

RMSE for VAR Model: 602.41

MAPE for VAR Model: 6.18

We forecasted the "Sales" for the next 6 weeks from 1st Aug 2015 to 11th September 2015 (42 Days or 6 Weeks) using VAR model
